Hello FTC Community! I am Andrew Chao, an FTC alumni with three years under my belt during my time as a high school competitior. I started back in 2021 during FREIGHT FRENZY.
Most of my FTC experience comes from my school's engineering courses, mainly my specialty in hardware, and my knowledge in programming mostly comes from the internet, along with other alumni.
By no means is this repository for every team, as my own coding experience as a long time hardware lead is limited, but it serves as an excellent introduction to beginners.
I hope these will serve you well in your own journey as an FTC team as it did I, and I look forward to seeing your creations in future seasons to come!


- Andrew Chao, FTC 15305 and 19510
